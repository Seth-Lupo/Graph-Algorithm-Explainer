			<p class="contentPara"><i>*This is a modified version of the TSP problem. Here, the sale's person's route can revisit nodes and edges. Also, the sales person does not need to visit every node, only specified nodes (houses). More formally, we are finding the <b>closed walk that contains all specified vertices of least cost,</b> not the Hamiltonian cycle of least cost. Though this is more difficult to solve, as it requires a specific preemptive steps, I find it to be more interesting and useful. I will explain the differences in full in the article.*</i></p>

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
